## Lab 9

### Objectives

- Use the Circuit Playground

### Code to write

1. In pyCharm or VS code, write a program that answers the following requirements:
   - Ask the user for the duration in seconds of a green light, yellow light and red light. Store the values in the variables `greenLight`, `yellowLight` and `redLight`. Use `try .. except` to protect the code from invalid inputs.
   - Simulate a street traffic light using the previous values and the `time.sleep` method.
   - Sample output in an infinite loop is:
     - print **Green light** (wait `greenLight` seconds)
     - print **Yellow light** (wait `yellowLight` seconds)
     - print **Red light** (wait `redLight` seconds)
   - Save the program as `lab9.py`
2. Using the Mu editor, learn how to switch on the leds on the circuit playground in a specific color.
3. Move the program lab9.py to the circuit playground, 
   - replace the steps that print with code that switch the leds on in the right color.
   - Save the program as `code.py`
